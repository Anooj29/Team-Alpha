Structural Overview of a Manim Script:

	Basic Structure:
		Import Manim classes: from manim import *.
		Define a class for each scene, inheriting from Scene (e.g., class MyScene(Scene):).
		Implement the construct() method to define the animation.

	Scene Lifecycle:
		Setup: Initialize objects.
		Animation: Add methods like self.play(), self.wait().
		Cleanup: Final adjustments and end scene.

Crafting Basic Scenes and Animations:

	Creating Objects:
		Shapes and Text: Use classes like Circle(), Square(), Text().
		Positioning: Use methods like move_to(), shift(), rotate().

	Animating Objects:
		Basic Animations: self.play(Create(obj)), self.play(FadeIn(obj)), self.play(Write(text)).
		Transformations: Transform(obj1, obj2), ApplyMethod(obj.method).
		
	Rendering:
		Render a scene: Run the script with manim script_name.py SceneClassName.
		Output options: Configure output video resolution and quality (e.g., -pqh for high-quality preview).
