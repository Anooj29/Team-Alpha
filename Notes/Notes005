Customization of Manim Settings for Optimal Performance:

	Configuration File:

		Modify manim.cfg or use command-line arguments to set global preferences.
		Examples:
		--quality (e.g., high_quality, medium_quality)
		--renderer (e.g., opengl, cairo)

	Scene Settings:

		Adjust scene properties for performance:
		Resolution: Use --resolution to set output resolution.
		Frame Rate: Adjust with --frame_height and --frame_width.

	Temporary Directories:

		Use --temp_dir to specify a directory for temporary files to avoid cluttering your workspace.


Extension of Manim Capabilities:

	Through Plugins and Custom Modules

	Plugins:

		Manim Community Plugins: Extend functionality with community-developed plugins.
		Installation: Typically installed via pip or by cloning repositories.

	Custom Modules:

		Create Custom Mobjects: Define new mobject types by subclassing Mobject.
		Create Custom Animations: Extend the Animation class to create new animation effects.

		Example:
			from manim import *

			class CustomShape(Mobject):
			    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
			        super().__init__(**kwargs)

			class CustomScene(Scene):
			    def construct(self):
			        shape = CustomShape()
			        self.play(Create(shape))


Optimization Strategies for Complex Animations:

	Pre-rendering:

		Render high-cost animations in segments and combine them.

	Reduce Complexity:

		Simplify mobjects and animations.
		Use lower resolution for draft renders.

	Efficient Use of .play():

		Combine multiple animations into a single self.play() call to reduce rendering overhead.

	Profiling and Debugging:

		Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.
		Optimize specific parts of the scene based on profiling results

	Use Caching:

		Cache static elements or pre-computed results to avoid recalculating during animations.
